# Identity Access Management System by Go

Yah the name of this project is a little 'big', I know, I know.

As a junior I do need some eye-catching techniques, right? I know a reasonable person like you would totally understand.

That being said, I am confident that this project is completed at a **more-than-a-junior** level. - I won't talk too much, 'cause I am showing you my code.

## What It Does ##
The usuals - user signup, user login,delete user, create / edit user profile, password hashing, access management, with relathional database;
JWT, Redis, deployed on AWS with Docker, blah blah blah you probably have read these on my resume.
I even wrote a customized middleware to handle request headers for authentication and authorization needs.

I did also wrote a simplest React frontend for it - the one repo called `IAM Client` - only the functional part, no fancy HTML5 and CSS.

## Why Golang? ##
In (my) layman's words - Go is very strict on types, and it provides very detailed, useful error information.

As a beginner, these features are extremely helpful for me to understand how objects are handled and passed from one another, their types, methods, interfaces...; and I don't have to run the program only to know I have already made a mistake. 

Plus, it was so much fun later when I played with goroutine and channels...

## Fun Fact ##
So many struggling nights and times and times of refactoring my own codes...
And this is my **very first project** as I offically started to learn coding;
And this is also **THE PROJECT** that I determined that this is something I would like to do everyday and as a career. **TOTALLY**.
